"""
1- Write a function called fizzbuzz that has a parameter n. fizzbuzz takes a numerical argument for the value of n, which is the maximum value to print up to. For example, if I gave you the number 30, I would expect your program to start at 1 and print up to 30.

2- Additionally, your function should do the following:

If a number is divisible by 3, print fizz
If a number is divisible by 5, print buzz
If a number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print fizzbuzz
If none of the above are true, just print the number itself
